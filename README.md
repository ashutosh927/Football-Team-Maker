# Football Team Maker
Not a random team divider. Make teams based on player skills.
Whenever i used to play football with my friends on weekend, we used to struggle as who will divide team. This led to a lot of delays as people act up.
We then used to try to random team makers, but the problem is it puts two goalkeepers in same team, no defender or attacker in a team, or simply overpowers one team because it just randomly put names together and does not have any system to identify players based on their roles or skills.
This is when i decided to code up an simple app to find a solution to this problem.
I worked in python however had no mood to sit for weeks and come with an algorithm, write it and test it. Hence, took the help of chatgpt to this and voila didn't even took me half an hour.
It's working pretty good and currently have my friends name stored in it. When i feel like, i might add an feature to let people add their names and create teams.
